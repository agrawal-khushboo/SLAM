In this project we implement the particle filter for the robot. The following files attached gives us the code of the functions used 

load_data.py: Gives the code of how to load the data and give its parametes saved as dictionary 

map_utils.py: Gives the code of necessary code functions to get the grids and test plotting the maps

slam_funnctions.py: Gives the code of the functions necessary to implement the particle filter, texture mapping and occupancy grid mapping

slam.py: it is main code which calls functions from slam_functions and runs the code on the data
